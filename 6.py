'''6. Company Bonus Distribution System


A company wants to calculate bonuses for employees based on their years of experience:

* More than 10 years → 20% bonus
* 5 to 10 years → 10% bonus
* 2 to 5 years → 5% bonus
* Less than 2 years → No bonus

Write a Python program to calculate the bonus amount.

Input:
Enter salary: 50000
Enter years of experience: 6

Output:
Bonus Amount: ₹5000'''

salary = float(input("Enter Salary: "))
exp = int(input("Enter years of Experience: "))

if  exp>10:
    print("Bonus Amount: ₹",salary*20/100)
elif exp>=5 and exp<=10:
    print("Bonus Amount: ₹",salary*10/100)
elif exp>=2 and exp<=5:
    print("Bonus Amount: ₹",salary*5/100)
else:
    print("Bonus Amount: ₹0")
