'''13. Employee Performance Appraisal System


A company evaluates employees based on performance rating (1–5):

* 5 → 25% salary hike
* 4 → 20% salary hike
* 3 → 10% salary hike
* 2 → 5% salary hike
* 1 → No hike
  If salary is below ₹20000 and rating is 4 or above, an additional ₹2000 bonus is given.

Write a Python program to calculate revised salary.

Input:
Enter salary: 18000
Enter rating: 4

Output:
Revised Salary: ₹23600'''

salary = float(input("Enter salary: "))
rating = int(input("Enter rating: "))

if rating==1:
    print("Revised Salary: ₹",salary)
elif rating==2:
    salary +=salary*5/100
    print("Revised Salary: ₹",salary)
elif rating==3:
    salary +=salary*10/100
    print("Revised Salary: ₹",salary)
elif  rating==4:
      if salary<20000:
           salary +=salary*20/100
           print("Revised Salary: ₹",salary+2000)
      else:
          salary +=salary*20/100
          print("Revised Salary: ₹",salary)
else:
      if salary<20000:
           salary +=salary*25/100
           print("Revised Salary: ₹",salary+2000)
      else:
          salary +=salary*25/100
          print("Revised Salary: ₹",salary)
