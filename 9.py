'''9. Student Attendance Eligibility System

A college determines whether a student is eligible to sit for exams based on attendance percentage:

* 75% and above → Eligible
* 60% to 74% → Eligible with warning
* Below 60% → Not eligible

Write a Python program to check eligibility.

Input:
Enter attendance percentage: 58

Output:
Status: Not Eligible'''
att = int(input("Enter attendance percentage:"))

if att>=60:
    if att>=60 and att<75:
        print("Status : Eligible With Warning!")
    else:
        print("Status : Eligible ")
else:
    print("Not allowed")
